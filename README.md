### <p align="center">Hello everyone :raised_hand:</p>

My name is **Kamil** and I am a **QA Engineer**. My career path as a tester started at the beginning of 2023. As a tester, I am committed to my daily duties, striving to ensure the best product quality. I perform manual and automated tests for web and mobile applications on a daily basis. At the end of 2023, I got an internship at [Mate Academy](https://mate.academy/pl), where I learned the basics of testing and performed various tasks.   I have several projects to my credit which I completed during my internship at Mate Academy and several of its own projects.
